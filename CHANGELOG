qtile 0.5:
    (Note, this is not complete! Many, many changes have gone in to 0.5, by a
    large number of contributors. Thanks to everyone who reported a bug or
    fixed one!)
    * features
        - Test framework is now nose
        - Documentation is now in sphinx
        - Several install guides for various OSes
        - New widgets: battery based icon, MPRIS1, canto, current layout, yahoo
          weather, sensors, screen brightness
        - Several improvements to old widgets (e.g. battery widget displays low
          battery in red, GroupBox now has a better indication of which screen
          has focus in multi-screen setups, etc.)
        - More sane way to handle configuration files
        - Promote dgroups to a first class entity in libqtile
        - Allow layouts to be named on an instance level, so you can:
            layouts = [
                # a layout just for gimp
                layout.Slice('left', 192, name='gimp', role='gimp-toolbox',
                    fallback=layout.Slice('right', 256, role='gimp-dock',
                    fallback=layout.Stack(stacks=1, **border_args)))
            ]
            ...

            dynamic_groups = { 'gimp': {'layout': 'gimp'} }

            Dgroups(..., dynamic_groups, ...)
