qtile $NEXT, released $DATE:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
    This release breaks your config file in several ways:
        - The Textbox widget no longer takes a ``name'' positional parameter,
          since it was redundant; you can use the ``name'' kwarg to define it.
        - manager.Group (now _Group) is not used to configure groups any more;
          config.Group replaces it. For simple configurations (i.e.
          Group("a") type configs), this should be a drop in replacement.
          config.Group also provides many more options for showing and hiding
          groups, assigning windows to groups by default, etc.
        - The Key, Screen, Drag, and Click objects have moved from the manager
          module to the config module.
        - The Match object has moved from the dgroups module to the config
          module.
    For most people, you should be able to just:
        sed -i -e 's/libqtile.manager/libqtile.config' config.py
    ...dgroups users will need to go to a bit more work, but hopefully
    configuration will be much simpler now for new users.
