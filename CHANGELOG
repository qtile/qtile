Qtile 0.26.0, released 2024-05-21:
    !!! breaking changes !!!
      - this release drops support for python 3.9
      - deleted the (very old) libqtile/command_* deprecation wrappers
      - SIGUSR2 no longer restarts qtile, instead it dumps stack traces
      - lazy.<object>.when(when_floating=X) now behaves differently: the lazy call will be executed
        independently of the current window's float state by default, and can be limited to when it
        is floating or tiled by passing when_floating as True or False respectively.
      - Dropped support for KDE idle protocol on Wayland
    !!! Notice for packagers - Wayland backend !!!
      - Qtile's Wayland backend now requires wlroots 0.17.x, pywlroots 0.17.x and pywayland >= 0.4.17.
    !!! Notice for pip package - Pypy !!!
      - We currently do not build for pypy-3.10 as there seems to be a resolution error in either pypy or pip (https://github.com/pypy/pypy/issues/4956)
    * features
      - For Wayland you can now set the cursor theme and size to forcefully use in Qtile,
        set `wl_xcursor_theme` and `wl_xcursor_size` in the configuration
      - automatically lift types to their annotated type when specified via
        the `qtile cmd-obj` command line
      - Add `Plasma` layout. The original layout (https://github.com/numirias/qtile-plasma) appears to be unmaintained
        so we have added this to the main codebase.
      - Add ability to specify muted and unmuted formats for `Volume` and `PulseVolume` widgets.
      - Add back server-side opacity support for Wayland backend
    * bugfixes

Qtile 0.25.0, released 2024-04-06:
    * features
      - The Battery widget now supports dynamic charge control, allowing for
        protecting battery life.
      - To support the above (plus the other widgets that modify sysfs), qtile
        now ships with its own udev rules, located at
        /resources/99-qtile.rules; distro packagers will probably want to
        install this rule set.
    * bugfixes
      - Fix groups marked with `persist=False` not being deleted when their last window is moved to another group.
      - Fallback icon in StatusNotifier widget

Qtile 0.24.0, released 2024-01-20:
    !!! config breakage/changes !!!
      - Matches no longer use "include/substring" style matching. But match the string exactly. Previously on X11, if the WM_TYPE of a spawned window is e.g. dialog a match with wm_type dialognoonereadschangelogs would return true. Additionally a window with an empty WM_CLASS (which can happen) would match anything. If you rely this style of substring matching, pass a regex to your match or use a function with func=.
        Using a list of strings inside Match with role, title, wm_class, wm_instance_class, wm_type are also deprecated, use a regex. Right now we replace the property with a regex if it's a list and warn with a deprecation message. You can use "qtile migrate" to migrate your config to this.
    * features
      - Change how `tox` runs tests. See https://docs.qtile.org/en/latest/manual/contributing.html#running-tests-locally
      for more information on how to run tests locally.
      - Add `ScreenSplit` layout which allows multiple layouts per screen. Also adds `ScreenSplit`
        widget to display name of active split.
      - Updated `Bluetooth` widget which allows users to manage multiple devices in a single widget
      - Add `align` option to `Columns` layout so new windows can be added to left or right column.
      - `.when()` have two new parameters:
        - `func: Callable`: Enable call when the result of the callable evaluates to True
        - `condition: bool`: a boolean value to determine whether the lazy object should be run. Unlike `func`, the
          condition is evaluated once when the config file is first loaded.
      - Add ability to have bar drawns over windows by adding `reserve=False` to bar's config to
        stop the bar reserving screen space.
      - Add ability for third-party code (widgets, layouts) to create hooks
      - Add ability to create user-defined hooks which can be fired from external scripts
    * bugfixes
      - Fix two bugs in stacking transient windows in X11
      - Checking configs containing `qtile.core.name` with `python config.py` don't fail anymore (but `qtile.core.name`
        will be `None`)
      - Fix an error if a wayland xwindow has unknown wm_type

Qtile 0.23.0, released 2023-09-24:
    !!! Dependency Changes !!!
      - xcffib must be upgraded to >= 1.4.0
      - cairocffi must be upgraded to >= 1.6.0
      - New optional dependency `pulsectl-asyncio` required for `PulseVolume` widget
    !!! Notice for packagers - wlroots (optional dependency) bump !!!
      - Qtile's wayland backend now requires on wlroots 0.16 (and pywlroots 0.16)
    !!! config breakage/changes !!!
      - The `cmd_` prefix has been dropped from all commands (this means command names are common when accessed
        via the command interface or internal python objects).
      - Custom widgets should now expose command methods with the `@expose_command` decorator (available via
        `from libqtile.command.base import expose_command`).
      - Some commands have been renamed (in addition to dropping the 'cmd_' prefix):
          `hints` -> `get_hints`
          `groups` -> `get_groups`
          `screens` -> `get_screens`
      - Layouts need to rename some methods:
        - `add` to `add_client`
        - `cmd_next` to `next`
        - `cmd_previous` to `previous`
      - Layouts or widgets that redefine the `commands` property need to update the signature:
          `@expose_command()`
          `def commands(self) -> list[str]:`
      - `Window.getsize` has been renamed `Window.get_size` (i.e. merged with the get_size command).
      - `Window.getposition` has been renamed `Window.get_position` (i.e. merged with the get_position command).
      - The `StockTicker` widget `function` option is being deprecated: rename it to `func`.
      - The formatting of `NetWidget` has changed, if you use the `format` parameter in your config include
        `up_suffix`, `total_suffix` and `down_suffix` to display the respective units.
      - The `Notify` widget now has separate `default_timeout` properties for differenct urgency levels. Previously,
        `default_timeout` was `None` which meant that there was no timeout for all notifications (unless this had been
        set by the client sending the notification). Now, `default_timeout` is for normal urgency notifications and this
        has been set to a default of 10 seconds. `default_timeout_urgent`, for critical notifications, has a timeout of `None`.
      - The `PulseVolume` widget now depends on a third party library, `pulsectl-asyncio`, to interact with the pulse audio
        server. Users will now see an `ImportError` until they install that library.
    * features
        - Add ability to set icon size in `LaunchBar` widget.
        - Add 'warp_pointer' option to `Drag` that when set will warp the pointer to the bottom right of
          the window when dragging begins.
        - Add `currentsong` status to `Mpd2` widget.
        - Add ability to disable group toggling in `GroupBox` widget
        - Add ability to have different border color when windows are stacked in Stack layout. Requires
          setting `border_focus_stack` and `border_normal_stack` variables.
        - Add ability to have different single border width for Columns layout by setting 'single_border_width' key.
        - Add ability to have different border and margin widths when VerticalTile layout only contains 1 window by
          setting 'single_border_width' and 'single_margin' keys.
        - New widget: GenPollCommand
        - Add `format` and `play_icon` parameters for styling cmus widget.
        - Add ability to add a group at a specified index
        - Add ability to spawn the `WidgetBox` widget opened.
        - Add ability to swap focused window based on index, and change the order of windows inside current group
        - Add ability to update the widget only once if `update_interval` is None.
        - Add `move_to_slice` command to move current window to single layout in `Slice` layout
        - Made the `NetWidget` text formattable.
        - Qtile no longer floods the log following X server disconnection, instead handling those errors.
        - `Key` and `KeyChord` bindings now have another argument `swallow`.
          It indicates whether or not the pressed keys should be passed on to the focused client.
          By default the keys are not passed (swallowed), so this argument is set to `True`.
          When set to `False`, the keys are passed to the focused client. A key is never swallowed if the
          function is not executed, e.g. due to failing the `.when()` check.
        - Add ability to set custom "Undefined" status key value to `Mpd2Widget`.
        - `Mpd2Widget` now searches for artist name in all similar keys (i.e `albumartist`, `performer`, etc.).
        - Add svg support to `CustomLayoutIcon`
        - added layering controls for X11 (Wayland support coming soon!):
          - `lazy.window.keep_above()/keep_below()` marks windows to be kept above/below other windows permanently.
             Calling the functions with no arguments toggles the state, otherwise pass `enable=True` or `enable=False`.
          - `lazy.window.move_up()/move_down()` moves windows up and down the z axis.
          - added `only_focused` setting to Max layout, allowing to draw multiple clients on top of each other when
            set to False
        - Add `suspend` hook to run functions before system goes to sleep.
    * bugfixes
        - Fix bug where Window.center() centers window on the wrong screen when using multiple monitors.
        - Fix `Notify` bug when apps close notifications.
        - Fix `CPU` precision bug with specific version of `psutil`
        - Fix config being reevaluated twice during reload (e.g. all hooks from config were doubled)
        - Fix `PulseVolume` high CPU usage when update_interval set to 0.
        - Fix `Battery` widget on FreeBSD without explicit `battery` index given.
        - Fix XMonad layout faulty call to nonexistent _shrink_up
        - Fix setting tiled position by mouse for layouts using _SimpleLayoutBase. To support this in other layouts, add a swap method taking two windows.
        - Fix unfullscreening bug in conjunction with Chromium based clients when auto_fullscreen is set to `False`.
        - Ensure `CurrentLayoutIcon` expands paths for custom folders.
        - Fix vertical alignment of icons in `TaskList` widget
        - Fix laggy resize/positioning of floating windows in X11 by handling motion notify events later. We also introduced a cap setting if you want to limit these events further, e.g. for limiting resource usage. This is configurable with the x11_drag_polling_rate variable for each `Screen` which is set to None by default, indicating no cap.
    * python version support
        - We have added support for python 3.11 and pypy 3.9.
        - python 3.7, 3.8 and pypy 3.7 are not longer supported.
        - Fix bug where `StatusNotifier` does not update icons

Qtile 0.22.0, released 2022-09-22:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - lazy.qtile.display_kb() no longer receives any arguments. If you passed it any arguments
          (which were ignored previously), remove them.
        - If you have a custom startup Python script that you use instead of `qtile start` and run init_log
          manually, the signature has changed. Please check the source for the updated arguments.
        - `KeyChord`'s signature has changed. ``mode`` is now a boolean to indicate whether the mode should persist.
          The ``name`` parameter should be used to name the chord (e.g. for the ``Chord`` widget).
    * features
        - Add ability to draw borders and add margins to the `Max` layout.
        - The default XWayland cursor is now set at startup to left_ptr, so an xsetroot call is not needed to
          avoid the ugly X cursor.
        - Wayland: primary clipboard should now behave same way as with X after selecting something it
          should be copied into clipboard

        - Wayland: Use `qtile cmd-obj -o core -f get_inputs` to get input device identifiers for
          configuring inputs. Also input configs will be updated by config reloads (pywlroots>=0.15.21)
    * bugfixes
        - Widgets that are incompatible with a backend (e.g. Systray on Wayland) will no longer show
          as a ConfigError in the bar. Instead the widget is silently removed from the bar and a message
          included in the logs.
        - Reduce error messages in `StatusNotifier` widget from certain apps.
        - Reset colours in `Chord` widget
        - Prevent crash in `LaunchBar` when using SVG icons
        - Improve scrolling in `Mpris2` widget (options to repeat scrolling etc.)

          to change this set `if_no_focused` to True.
        - Widget with duplicate names will be automatically renamed by appending numeric suffixes
        - Fix resizing of wallpaper when screen scale changes (X11)

          on all windows but Systray has icons (which are non-commandable `_Window`s.)
        - Fix bug where bars were not reconfigured correctly when screen layout changes.
        - Fix a Wayland bug where layer-shell surface like dunst would freeze up and stop updating.

          NB Widget does not provide context menus.
        - Add `total` bandwidth format value to the Net widget.
        - Scratchpad groups could be defined as single so that only one of the scratchpad in the group is visible
          at a given time.
        - All scratchpads in a Scratchpad group can be hidden with hide_all() function.
        - For saving states of scratchpads during restart, we use wids instead of pids.
        - Scratchpads can now be defined with an optional matcher to match with window properties.
        - `Qtile.cmd_reload_config` is added for reloading the config without completely restarting.
        - Window.cmd_togroup's argument `groupName` should be changed to
          `group_name`. For the time being a log warning is in place and a
          migration is added. In the future `groupName` will fail.
        - Add `min/max_ratio` to Tile layout and fix bug where windows can extend offscreen.
        - Add ability for widget `mouse_callbacks` to take `lazy` calls (similar to keybindings)
        - Add `aliases` to `lazy.spawncmd()` which takes a dictionary mapping convenient aliases
          to full command lines.
        - Add a new 'prefix' option to the net widget to display speeds with a static unit (e.g. MB).
        - `lazy.group.toscreen()` now does not toggle groups by default. To get this behaviour back, use

          they will draw multiple borders on the appropriate windows.

Qtile 0.18.0, released 2021-07-04:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - The `qtile` entry point doesn't run `qtile start` by default anymore
        - New optional dependency for dbus related features: dbus-next.
          Replaces previous reliance on dbus/Glib and allows qtile to use async
          dbus calls within asyncio's eventloop.
        - widget.BatteryIcon no longer has a fallback text mode; use
          widget.Battery instead
        - MonadX layout key new_at_current is deprecated, use new_client_position.

        - added transparency in x11 and wayland backends
        - added measure_mem and measure_swap attributes to memory widget to allow user to choose measurement units.
        - memory widget can now be displayed with decimal values
        - new "qtile migrate" command, which will attempt to upgrade previous
          configs to the current version in the case of qtile API breaks.
        - A new `reconfigure_screens` config setting. When `True` (default) it
          hooks `Qtile.reconfigure_screens` to the `screen_change` hook,
          reconfiguring qtile's screens in response to randr events. This
          removes the need to restart qtile when adding/removing external
          monitors.
        - improved key chord / sequence functionality. Leaving a chord with `mode`
          set brings you to a named mode you activated before, see #2264.
          A new command, `lazy.ungrab_all_chords`, was introduced to return to the root bindings.
          The `enter_chord` hook is now always called with a string argument.
          The third argument to `KeyChord` was renamed from `submaping` to `submapping` (typo fix).
        - added new argument for CheckUpdates widget: `custom_command_modify` which allows user to modify the
          the line count of the output of `custom_command` with a lambda function (i.e. `lambda x: x-3`).
          Argument defaults to `lambda x: x` and is overridden by `distro` argument's internal lambda.
        - added new argument for the WindowName, WindowTabs and Tasklist widgets: `parse_text` which allows users to
          define a function that takes a window name as an input, modify it in some way (e.g. str.replace(), str.upper() or regex)
          and show that modification on screen.
        - A Wayland backend has been added which can be used by calling `qtile start -b wayland` directly in your TTY.
          It requires the latest releases of wlroots, python-xkbcommon, pywayland and pywlroots. It is expected to be
          unstable so please let us know if you find any bugs!
        - The 'focus` argument to `Click` and `Drag` objects in your config are no longer necessary (and are ignored).

Qtile 0.17.0, released 2021-02-13:
    !!! Python version breakage !!!
        - Python 3.5 and 3.6 are no longer supported
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - Pacman widget has been removed. Use CheckUpdates instead.
        - Mpris widget has been removed. Use Mpris2 instead.
        - property "masterWindows" of Tile layout renamed to master_length
        - Match objects now only allow one string argument for their wm
          name/class/etc. properties. to update your config, do e.g.
                   Group('www', spawn='firefox', layout='xmonad',
              -          matches=[Match(wm_class=['Firefox', 'google-chrome', 'Google-chrome'])]),
              +          matches=[Match(wm_class='Firefox'), Match(wm_class='google-chrome'), Match(wm_class='Google-chrome')]),
        - properties wname, wmclass and role of Slice-layout replaced by Match-
          type property "match"
        - rules specified in `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` are now evaluated with
          AND-semantics instead of OR-semantics, i.e. if you specify 2 different
          property rules, both have to match
        - check the new `float_rules` for `floating_layout` in the default config and
          extend your own rules appropriately: some non-configurable auto-floating rules
          were made explicit and added to the default config
        - using `dict`s for `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` is now deprecated, please
          use `config.Match` objects instead
        - `no_reposition_match` in `layout.Floating` has been removed; use the list of
          `config.Match`-objects `no_reposition_rules` instead
        - Command line has been modernized to a single entry point, the `qtile`
          binary. Translations are below:
                qtile     -> qtile start
                qtile-cmd -> qtile cmd-obj
                qtile-run -> qtile run-cmd
                qtile-top -> qtile top
                qshell    -> qtile shell
          iqshell and dqtile-cmd are no longer distributed with the
          package, as they were either user or developer scripts. Both are
          still available in the qtile repo in /scripts.

          Running `qtile` without arguments will continue to work for the
          forseeable future, but will be eventually deprecated. qtile prints a
          warning when run in this configuration.
        - Qtile.cmd_focus_by_click is no longer an available command.
        - Qtile.cmd_get_info is no longer an available command.
        - libqtile.command_* has been deprecated, it has been moved to
          libqtile.command.*
        - libqtile.widget.base.ThreadedPollText has been removed; out of tree
          widgets can use ThreadPoolText in the same package instead.
        - the YahooWeather widget was removed since Yahoo retired their free
          tier of the weather API
        - Deprecated hook `window_name_change` got removed, use
          `client_name_updated` instead.
        - show_state attribute from WindowName widget has been removed. Use format attribute instead.
                show_state = True  -> format = '{state}{name}'
                show_state = False -> format = '{name}'
        - mouse_callbacks no longer receives the qtile object as an argument
          (they receive no arguments); import it via `from libqtile import
          qtile` instead.
    * features
        - new WidgetBox widget
        - new restart and shutdown hooks
        - rules specified in `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` are now evaluated with
          AND-semantics, allowing for more complex and specific rules
        - Python 3.9 support
        - switch to Github Actions for CI
        - Columns layout has new `margin_on_single` option to specify margin
          size when there is only one window (default -1: use `margin` option).
        - new OpenWeather widget to replace YahooWeather
        - new format attribute for WindowName widget
        - new max_chars attribute for WindowName widget
        - libqtile now exports type information
        - add a new `qtile check` subcommand, which will check qtile configs
          for various things:
              - validates configs against the newly exported type information
                if mypy is present in the environment
              - validates that qtile can import the config file (e.g. that
                syntax is correct, ends in a .py extension, etc.)
              - validates Key and Mouse mod/keysym arguments are ok.
        - Columns layout now enables column swapping by using swap_column_left and swap_column_right
    !!! warning !!!
        - When (re)starting, Qtile passes its state to the new process in a
          file now, where previously it passed state directly as a string. This
          fixes a bug where some character encodings (i.e. in group names) were
          getting messed up in the conversion to/from said string. This change
          will cause issues if you update Qtile then restart it, causing the
          running old version to pass state in the previous format to the new
          process which recognises the new.

Qtile 0.16.1, released 2020-08-11:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - Hooks 'addgroup', 'delgroup' and 'screen_change' will no longer
          receive the qtile object as an argument. It can be accessed directly
          at libqtile.qtile.
    !!! deprecation warning !!!
        - defining a main function in your config is deprecated. You should use
          @hook.subscribe.startup_complete instead. If you need access to the
          qtile object, import it from libqtile directly.
    * bugfixes
        - include tests in the release for distros to consume
        - don't resize 0th screen incorrectly on root ConfigureNotify
        - expose qtile object as libqtile.qtile (note that we still consider
          anything not prefixed with cmd_ to be a private API)
        - fix transparent borders
        - MonadTall, MonadWide, and TreeTab now work with Slice

Qtile 0.16.0, released 2020-07-20:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - Imports from libqtile.widget are now made through a function
          proxy to avoid the side effects of importing all widgets at
          once. If you subclass a widget in your config, import it from
          its own module.
          e.g. from libqtile.widget.pomodoro import Pomodoro
    * features

    !!! Python version breakage !!!
        - Python 2 is no longer supported
        - Python 3.4 and older is no longer supported
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - Many internal things were renamed from camel case to snake case. If
          your config uses main(), or any lazy.function() invocations that
          interact directly with the qtile object, you may need to forward port
          them. Also note that we do *not* consider the qtile object to be a
          stable api, so you will need to continue forward porting these things
          for future refactorings (for wayland, etc.). A better approach may be
          to add an upstream API for what you want to do ;)

Qtile 0.9.1, released 2015-02-13:
    This is primarily a unicode bugfix release for 0.9.0; there were several
    nits related to the python2/3 unicode conversion that were simply wrong.
    This release also adds license headers to each file, which is necessary for
    distro maintainers to package Qtile.
    * bugfixes
        - fix python2's importing of gobject
        - fix unicode handling in several places

Qtile 0.9.0, released 2015-01-20:
    * !!! Dependency Changes !!!
      New dependencies will need to be installed for Qtile to work
        - drop xpyb for xcffib (XCB bindings)
        - drop py2cairo for cairocffi (Cairo bindings)
        - drop PyGTK for asyncio (event loop, pangocairo bindings managed
          internally)
        - Qtile still depends on gobject if you want to use anything that uses
          dbus (e.g. the mpris widgets or the libnotify widget)
    * features
        - add Python 3 and pypy support (made possible by dependency changes)
        - new layout for vertical monitors
        - add startup_once hook, which is called exactly once per session (i.e.
          it is not called when qtile is restarted via lazy.restart()). This
          eliminates the need for the execute_once() function found in lots of
          user configs.
        - add a command for showing/hiding the bar (lazy.hide_show_bar())
        - warn when a widget's dependencies cannot be imported
        - make qtile.log more useful via better warnings in general, including
          deprecation and various other warnings that were previously
          nonexistent
        - new text-polling widget super classes, which enable easy
          implementation of various widgets that need to poll things outside
          the event loop.
        - add man pages
        - large documentation update, widget/layout documentation is now
          autogenerated from the docstrings
        - new ImapWidget for checking imap mailboxes
    * bugfixes
        - change default wmname to "LG3D" (this prevents some java apps from
          not working out of the box)
        - all code passes flake8
        - default log level is now WARNING
        - all widgets now use our config framework

Qtile 0.6, released 2013-05-11:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
    This release breaks your config file in several ways:
        - The Textbox widget no longer takes a ``name'' positional parameter,
          since it was redundant; you can use the ``name'' kwarg to define it.
        - manager.Group (now _Group) is not used to configure groups any more;
          config.Group replaces it. For simple configurations (i.e.
          Group("a") type configs), this should be a drop in replacement.
          config.Group also provides many more options for showing and hiding
          groups, assigning windows to groups by default, etc.
        - The Key, Screen, Drag, and Click objects have moved from the manager
          module to the config module.
        - The Match object has moved from the dgroups module to the config
          module.
        - The addgroup hook now takes two parameters: the qtile object and the
          name of the group added:
              @hook.subscribe
              def addgroup_hook(qtile, name):
                  pass
        - The nextgroup and prevgroup commands are now on Screen instead of
          Group.
    For most people, you should be able to just:
        sed -i -e 's/libqtile.manager/libqtile.config' config.py
    ...dgroups users will need to go to a bit more work, but hopefully
    configuration will be much simpler now for new users.
    * features
        - New widgets: task list,
        - New layout: Matrix
        - Added ability to drag and drop groups on GroupBox
        - added "next urgent window" command
        - added font shadowing on widgets
        - maildir widget supports multiple folders
        - new config option log_level to set logging level (any of
          logging.{DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL})
        - add option to battery widget to hide while level is above a certain
          amount
        - vastly simplify configuration of dynamic groups
        - MPD widget now supports lots of metadata options
    * bugfixes
        - don't crash on restart when the config has errors
        - save layout and selected group state on restart
        - varous EWMH properties implemented correctly
        - fix non-black systray icon backgrounds
        - drastically reduce the number of timeout_add calls in most widgets
        - restart on RandR attach events to allow for new screens
        - log level defaults to ERROR
        - default config options are no longer initialized when users define
          their corresponding option (preventing duplicate widgets, etc.)
        - don't try to load config in qsh (not used)
        - fix font alignment across Textbox based widgets

        - More sane way to handle configuration files
        - Promote dgroups to a first class entity in libqtile
        - Allow layouts to be named on an instance level, so you can:

                layout.Slice('left', 192, name='gimp', role='gimp-toolbox',
                    fallback=layout.Slice('right', 256, role='gimp-dock',
                    fallback=layout.Stack(stacks=1, **border_args)))
            ]
            ...

            dynamic_groups = { 'gimp': {'layout': 'gimp'} }
