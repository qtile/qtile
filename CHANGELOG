qtile 0.9.1, released 2015-02-13:
    This is primarily a unicode bugfix release for 0.9.0; there were several
    nits related to the python2/3 unicode conversion that were simply wrong.
    This release also adds license headers to each file, which is necessary for
    distro maintainers to package Qtile.
    * bugfixes
        - fix python2's importing of gobject
        - fix unicode handling in several places

qtile 0.9.0, released 2015-01-20:
    * !!! Dependency Changes !!!
      New dependencies will need to be installed for qtile to work
        - drop xpyb for xcffib (XCB bindings)
        - drop py2cairo for cairocffi (Cairo bindings)
        - drop PyGTK for asyncio (event loop, pangocairo bindings managed
          internally)
        - qtile still depends on gobject if you want to use anything that uses
          dbus (e.g. the mpris widgets or the libnotify widget)
    * features
        - add Python 3 and pypy support (made possible by dependency changes)
        - new layout for vertical monitors
        - add startup_once hook, which is called exactly once per session (i.e.

          eliminates the need for the execute_once() function found in lots of
          user configs.

        - warn when a widget's dependencies cannot be imported
        - make qtile.log more useful via better warnings in general, including
          deprecation and various other warnings that were previously
          nonexistent
        - new text-polling widget super classes, which enable easy
          implementation of various widgets that need to poll things outside
          the event loop.
        - add man pages
        - large documentation update, widget/layout documentation is now
          autogenerated from the docstrings
        - new ImapWidget for checking imap mailboxes
    * bugfixes

        - default log level is now WARNING
        - all widgets now use our config framework

qtile 0.6, released 2013-05-11:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
    This release breaks your config file in several ways:
        - The Textbox widget no longer takes a ``name'' positional parameter,
          since it was redundant; you can use the ``name'' kwarg to define it.
        - manager.Group (now _Group) is not used to configure groups any more;
          config.Group replaces it. For simple configurations (i.e.
          Group("a") type configs), this should be a drop in replacement.
          config.Group also provides many more options for showing and hiding
          groups, assigning windows to groups by default, etc.
        - The Key, Screen, Drag, and Click objects have moved from the manager
          module to the config module.
        - The Match object has moved from the dgroups module to the config
          module.
        - The addgroup hook now takes two parameters: the qtile object and the
          name of the group added:
              @hook.subscribe
              def addgroup_hook(qtile, name):
                  pass
        - The nextgroup and prevgroup commands are now on Screen instead of
          Group.
    For most people, you should be able to just:
        sed -i -e 's/libqtile.manager/libqtile.config' config.py
    ...dgroups users will need to go to a bit more work, but hopefully
    configuration will be much simpler now for new users.
    * features
        - New widgets: task list,
        - New layout: Matrix
        - Added ability to drag and drop groups on GroupBox
        - added "next urgent window" command
        - added font shadowing on widgets
        - maildir widget supports multiple folders
        - new config option log_level to set logging level (any of
          logging.{DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL})
        - add option to battery widget to hide while level is above a certain
          amount
        - vastly simplify configuration of dynamic groups
        - MPD widget now supports lots of metadata options
    * bugfixes
        - don't crash on restart when the config has errors
        - save layout and selected group state on restart
        - varous EWMH properties implemented correctly
        - fix non-black systray icon backgrounds
        - drastically reduce the number of timeout_add calls in most widgets
        - restart on RandR attach events to allow for new screens
        - log level defaults to ERROR
        - default config options are no longer initialized when users define
          their corresponding option (preventing duplicate widgets, etc.)
        - don't try to load config in qsh (not used)
        - fix font alignment across Textbox based widgets

          has focus in multi-screen setups, improvements to Prompt, etc.)
        - Desktop notification service.
        - More sane way to handle configuration files
        - Promote dgroups to a first class entity in libqtile
        - Allow layouts to be named on an instance level, so you can:

                # a layout just for gimp
                layout.Slice('left', 192, name='gimp', role='gimp-toolbox',
                    fallback=layout.Slice('right', 256, role='gimp-dock',
                    fallback=layout.Stack(stacks=1, **border_args)))
            ]
            ...

            dynamic_groups = { 'gimp': {'layout': 'gimp'} }
