Qtile 0.x.x, released xxxx-xx-xx:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - The `qtile` entry point doesn't run `qtile start` by default anymore
        - New optional dependency for dbus related features: dbus-next.
          Replaces previous reliance on dbus/Glib and allows qtile to use async
          dbus calls within asyncio's eventloop.
        - widget.BatteryIcon no longer has a fallback text mode; use
          widget.Battery instead
        - MonadX layout key new_at_current is deprecated, use new_client_position.
        - `libqtile.window` has been moved to `libqtile.backend.x11.window`; a migration has been added for this.
    !!! deprecation warning !!!
        - 'main' config functions, deprecated in 0.16.1, will no longer be executed.
    * features
        - added measure_mem and measure_swap attributes to memory widget to allow user to choose measurement units.
        - memory widget can now be displayed with decimal values
        - new "qtile migrate" command, which will attempt to upgrade previous
          configs to the current version in the case of qtile API breaks.
        - A new `reconfigure_screens` config setting. When `True` (default) it
          hooks `Qtile.reconfigure_screens` to the `screen_change` hook,
          reconfiguring qtile's screens in response to randr events. This
          removes the need to restart qtile when adding/removing external
          monitors.
        - improved key chord / sequence functionality. Leaving a chord with `mode`
          set brings you to a named mode you activated before, see #2264.
          A new command, `lazy.ungrab_all_chords`, was introduced to return to the root bindings.
          The `enter_chord` hook is now always called with a string argument.
          The third argument to `KeyChord` was renamed from `submaping` to `submapping` (typo fix).
        - added new argument for CheckUpdates widget: `custom_command_modify` which allows user to modify the
          the line count of the output of `custom_command` with a lambda function (i.e. `lambda x: x-3`).
          Argument defaults to `lambda x: x` and is overridden by `distro` argument's internal lambda.
        - A Wayland backend has been added which can be used with `qtile start -b wayland`. It is undergoing heavy development
          and bugs are to be expected, but if you find any bugs or conspicuously missing features that are not listed on our
          to do list at https://github.com/qtile/qtile/discussions/2409 please do let us know. The backend requires pywlroots
          and its dependencies python-xkbcommon, pywayland and wlroots 0.13.0.

Qtile 0.17.0, released 2021-02-13:
    !!! Python version breakage !!!
        - Python 3.5 and 3.6 are no longer supported
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - Pacman widget has been removed. Use CheckUpdates instead.
        - Mpris widget has been removed. Use Mpris2 instead.
        - property "masterWindows" of Tile layout renamed to master_length
        - Match objects now only allow one string argument for their wm
          name/class/etc. properties. to update your config, do e.g.
                   Group('www', spawn='firefox', layout='xmonad',
              -          matches=[Match(wm_class=['Firefox', 'google-chrome', 'Google-chrome'])]),
              +          matches=[Match(wm_class='Firefox'), Match(wm_class='google-chrome'), Match(wm_class='Google-chrome')]),
        - properties wname, wmclass and role of Slice-layout replaced by Match-
          type property "match"
        - rules specified in `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` are now evaluated with
          AND-semantics instead of OR-semantics, i.e. if you specify 2 different
          property rules, both have to match
        - check the new `float_rules` for `floating_layout` in the default config and
          extend your own rules appropriately: some non-configurable auto-floating rules
          were made explicit and added to the default config
        - using `dict`s for `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` is now deprecated, please
          use `config.Match` objects instead
        - `no_reposition_match` in `layout.Floating` has been removed; use the list of
          `config.Match`-objects `no_reposition_rules` instead
        - Command line has been modernized to a single entry point, the `qtile`
          binary. Translations are below:
                qtile     -> qtile start
                qtile-cmd -> qtile cmd-obj
                qtile-run -> qtile run-cmd
                qtile-top -> qtile top
                qshell    -> qtile shell
          iqshell and dqtile-cmd are no longer distributed with the
          package, as they were either user or developer scripts. Both are
          still available in the qtile repo in /scripts.

          Running `qtile` without arguments will continue to work for the
          forseeable future, but will be eventually deprecated. qtile prints a
          warning when run in this configuration.
        - Qtile.cmd_focus_by_click is no longer an available command.
        - Qtile.cmd_get_info is no longer an available command.
        - libqtile.command_* has been deprecated, it has been moved to
          libqtile.command.*
        - libqtile.widget.base.ThreadedPollText has been removed; out of tree
          widgets can use ThreadPoolText in the same package instead.
        - the YahooWeather widget was removed since Yahoo retired their free
          tier of the weather API
        - Deprecated hook `window_name_change` got removed, use
          `client_name_updated` instead.
        - show_state attribute from WindowName widget has been removed. Use format attribute instead.
                show_state = True  -> format = '{state}{name}'
                show_state = False -> format = '{name}'
        - mouse_callbacks no longer receives the qtile object as an argument
          (they receive no arguments); import it via `from libqtile import
          qtile` instead.
    * features
        - new WidgetBox widget
        - new restart and shutdown hooks
        - rules specified in `layout.Floating`'s `float_rules` are now evaluated with
          AND-semantics, allowing for more complex and specific rules
        - Python 3.9 support
        - switch to Github Actions for CI
        - Columns layout has new `margin_on_single` option to specify margin
          size when there is only one window (default -1: use `margin` option).
        - new OpenWeather widget to replace YahooWeather
        - new format attribute for WindowName widget
        - new max_chars attribute for WindowName widget
        - libqtile now exports type information
        - add a new `qtile check` subcommand, which will check qtile configs
          for various things:
              - validates configs against the newly exported type information
                if mypy is present in the environment
              - validates that qtile can import the config file (e.g. that
                syntax is correct, ends in a .py extension, etc.)
              - validates Key and Mouse mod/keysym arguments are ok.
        - Columns layout now enables column swapping by using swap_column_left and swap_column_right
    !!! warning !!!
        - When (re)starting, Qtile passes its state to the new process in a
          file now, where previously it passed state directly as a string. This
          fixes a bug where some character encodings (i.e. in group names) were
          getting messed up in the conversion to/from said string. This change
          will cause issues if you update Qtile then restart it, causing the
          running old version to pass state in the previous format to the new
          process which recognises the new.

Qtile 0.16.1, released 2020-08-11:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - Hooks 'addgroup', 'delgroup' and 'screen_change' will no longer
          receive the qtile object as an argument. It can be accessed directly
          at libqtile.qtile.
    !!! deprecation warning !!!
        - defining a main function in your config is deprecated. You should use
          @hook.subscribe.startup_complete instead. If you need access to the
          qtile object, import it from libqtile directly.
    * bugfixes
        - include tests in the release for distros to consume
        - don't resize 0th screen incorrectly on root ConfigureNotify
        - expose qtile object as libqtile.qtile (note that we still consider
          anything not prefixed with cmd_ to be a private API)
        - fix transparent borders
        - MonadTall, MonadWide, and TreeTab now work with Slice

Qtile 0.16.0, released 2020-07-20:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - Imports from libqtile.widget are now made through a function
          proxy to avoid the side effects of importing all widgets at
          once. If you subclass a widget in your config, import it from
          its own module.
          e.g. from libqtile.widget.pomodoro import Pomodoro

        - Python 3.4 and older is no longer supported
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - Many internal things were renamed from camel case to snake case. If
          your config uses main(), or any lazy.function() invocations that
          interact directly with the qtile object, you may need to forward port
          them. Also note that we do *not* consider the qtile object to be a
          stable api, so you will need to continue forward porting these things
          for future refactorings (for wayland, etc.). A better approach may be
          to add an upstream API for what you want to do ;)

Qtile 0.9.1, released 2015-02-13:
    This is primarily a unicode bugfix release for 0.9.0; there were several
    nits related to the python2/3 unicode conversion that were simply wrong.
    This release also adds license headers to each file, which is necessary for
    distro maintainers to package Qtile.
    * bugfixes
        - fix python2's importing of gobject
        - fix unicode handling in several places

Qtile 0.9.0, released 2015-01-20:
    * !!! Dependency Changes !!!
      New dependencies will need to be installed for Qtile to work
        - drop xpyb for xcffib (XCB bindings)
        - drop py2cairo for cairocffi (Cairo bindings)
        - drop PyGTK for asyncio (event loop, pangocairo bindings managed
          internally)
        - Qtile still depends on gobject if you want to use anything that uses
          dbus (e.g. the mpris widgets or the libnotify widget)
    * features
        - add Python 3 and pypy support (made possible by dependency changes)
        - new layout for vertical monitors
        - add startup_once hook, which is called exactly once per session (i.e.
          it is not called when qtile is restarted via lazy.restart()). This
          eliminates the need for the execute_once() function found in lots of
          user configs.
        - add a command for showing/hiding the bar (lazy.hide_show_bar())
        - warn when a widget's dependencies cannot be imported
        - make qtile.log more useful via better warnings in general, including
          deprecation and various other warnings that were previously
          nonexistent
        - new text-polling widget super classes, which enable easy
          implementation of various widgets that need to poll things outside
          the event loop.
        - add man pages
        - large documentation update, widget/layout documentation is now
          autogenerated from the docstrings
        - new ImapWidget for checking imap mailboxes
    * bugfixes
        - change default wmname to "LG3D" (this prevents some java apps from
          not working out of the box)
        - all code passes flake8
        - default log level is now WARNING
        - all widgets now use our config framework

Qtile 0.6, released 2013-05-11:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
    This release breaks your config file in several ways:
        - The Textbox widget no longer takes a ``name'' positional parameter,
          since it was redundant; you can use the ``name'' kwarg to define it.
        - manager.Group (now _Group) is not used to configure groups any more;
          config.Group replaces it. For simple configurations (i.e.
          Group("a") type configs), this should be a drop in replacement.
          config.Group also provides many more options for showing and hiding
          groups, assigning windows to groups by default, etc.
        - The Key, Screen, Drag, and Click objects have moved from the manager
          module to the config module.
        - The Match object has moved from the dgroups module to the config
          module.
        - The addgroup hook now takes two parameters: the qtile object and the
          name of the group added:
              @hook.subscribe
              def addgroup_hook(qtile, name):
                  pass
        - The nextgroup and prevgroup commands are now on Screen instead of
          Group.
    For most people, you should be able to just:
        sed -i -e 's/libqtile.manager/libqtile.config' config.py
    ...dgroups users will need to go to a bit more work, but hopefully
    configuration will be much simpler now for new users.
    * features
        - New widgets: task list,
        - New layout: Matrix
        - Added ability to drag and drop groups on GroupBox
        - added "next urgent window" command
        - added font shadowing on widgets
        - maildir widget supports multiple folders
        - new config option log_level to set logging level (any of
          logging.{DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL})
        - add option to battery widget to hide while level is above a certain
          amount
        - vastly simplify configuration of dynamic groups
        - MPD widget now supports lots of metadata options
    * bugfixes
        - don't crash on restart when the config has errors
        - save layout and selected group state on restart
        - varous EWMH properties implemented correctly
        - fix non-black systray icon backgrounds
        - drastically reduce the number of timeout_add calls in most widgets
        - restart on RandR attach events to allow for new screens
        - log level defaults to ERROR
        - default config options are no longer initialized when users define
          their corresponding option (preventing duplicate widgets, etc.)
        - don't try to load config in qsh (not used)
        - fix font alignment across Textbox based widgets

        - More sane way to handle configuration files
        - Promote dgroups to a first class entity in libqtile
        - Allow layouts to be named on an instance level, so you can:

                layout.Slice('left', 192, name='gimp', role='gimp-toolbox',
                    fallback=layout.Slice('right', 256, role='gimp-dock',
                    fallback=layout.Stack(stacks=1, **border_args)))
            ]
            ...

            dynamic_groups = { 'gimp': {'layout': 'gimp'} }
