    !!! Python version breakage !!!
        - Python 2 is no longer supported
        - Python 3.4 and older is no longer supported
    !!! Config breakage !!!
        - Many internal things were renamed from camel case to snake case. If
          your config uses main(), or any lazy.function() invocations that
          interact directly with the qtile object, you may need to forward port
          them. Also note that we do *not* consider the qtile object to be a
          stable api, so you will need to continue forward porting these things
          for future refactorings (for wayland, etc.). A better approach may be
          to add an upstream API for what you want to do ;)

    This release also adds license headers to each file, which is necessary for
    distro maintainers to package Qtile.

qtile 0.9.0, released 2015-01-20:

        - drop py2cairo for cairocffi (Cairo bindings)
        - drop PyGTK for asyncio (event loop, pangocairo bindings managed
          internally)

          user configs.

        - warn when a widget's dependencies cannot be imported

          implementation of various widgets that need to poll things outside
          the event loop.

qtile 0.6, released 2013-05-11:
    !!! Config breakage !!!
    This release breaks your config file in several ways:
        - The Textbox widget no longer takes a ``name'' positional parameter,
          since it was redundant; you can use the ``name'' kwarg to define it.
        - manager.Group (now _Group) is not used to configure groups any more;
          config.Group replaces it. For simple configurations (i.e.
          Group("a") type configs), this should be a drop in replacement.
          config.Group also provides many more options for showing and hiding
          groups, assigning windows to groups by default, etc.
        - The Key, Screen, Drag, and Click objects have moved from the manager
          module to the config module.
        - The Match object has moved from the dgroups module to the config
          module.
        - The addgroup hook now takes two parameters: the qtile object and the
          name of the group added:
              @hook.subscribe
              def addgroup_hook(qtile, name):
                  pass
        - The nextgroup and prevgroup commands are now on Screen instead of
          Group.
    For most people, you should be able to just:
        sed -i -e 's/libqtile.manager/libqtile.config' config.py
    ...dgroups users will need to go to a bit more work, but hopefully
    configuration will be much simpler now for new users.
    * features
        - New widgets: task list,
        - New layout: Matrix
        - Added ability to drag and drop groups on GroupBox
        - added "next urgent window" command
        - added font shadowing on widgets
        - maildir widget supports multiple folders
        - new config option log_level to set logging level (any of
          logging.{DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL})
        - add option to battery widget to hide while level is above a certain
          amount
        - vastly simplify configuration of dynamic groups
        - MPD widget now supports lots of metadata options

        - restart on RandR attach events to allow for new screens
        - log level defaults to ERROR
        - default config options are no longer initialized when users define
          their corresponding option (preventing duplicate widgets, etc.)
        - don't try to load config in qsh (not used)
        - fix font alignment across Textbox based widgets

        - More sane way to handle configuration files
        - Promote dgroups to a first class entity in libqtile

                # a layout just for gimp
                layout.Slice('left', 192, name='gimp', role='gimp-toolbox',
                    fallback=layout.Slice('right', 256, role='gimp-dock',
                    fallback=layout.Stack(stacks=1, **border_args)))
            ]
            ...

            dynamic_groups = { 'gimp': {'layout': 'gimp'} }
