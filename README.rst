  widgets and commands.
* Configured in Python.
* Runs as an X11 WM or a Wayland compositor.
* Command shell that allows all aspects of Qtile to be managed and
  inspected.
* Complete remote scriptability - write scripts to set up workspaces,
  manipulate windows, update status bar widgets and more.
* Qtile's remote scriptability makes it one of the most thoroughly
  unit-tested window managers around.
