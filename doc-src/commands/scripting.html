Client-Server Scripting Model
=============================

Qtile has a client-server control model - the main Qtile instance listens on a
named pipe, over which marshalled command calls and response data is passed.
This allows Qtile to be controlled fully from external scripts. Remote
interaction occurs through an instance of the __libqtile.command.Client__
class. This class establishes a connection to the currently running instance of
Qtile, and sources the user's configuration file to figure out which commands
should be exposed. Commands then appear as methods with the appropriate
signature on the __Client__ object.  The object hierarchy is described in the
@!linkTo("commands.html")!@ section of this manual. Full command documentation
is available through the @!aLink("qsh.html", "Qtile Shell")!@.


Example
=======

Below is a very minimal example script that inspects the current qtile
instance, and returns the integer offset of the current screen.
