__Qtile is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager written in Python.__

Features
========

* Simple, small and extensible. It's easy to write your own layouts,
  widgets and built-in commands.
* Configured entirely in Python. 
* Command-line shell that allows all aspects of Qtile to be manipulated and inspected.
* Complete remote scriptability - write scripts to set up workspaces,
  manipulate windows, update status bar widgets and more.
* Qtile's scriptability has made thorough unit testing possible,
  making it one of the best-tested window managers around.


Dependencies
============

Qtile relies on some cutting-edge features in PyCairo, XCB, and xpyb. Until the
latest versions of these projects make it into distros, it's best to use recent
checkouts from their repositories. Here's a brief step-by-step guide:


libxcb
------

    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xcb/libxcb
    cd libxcb
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

xpyb
----

The xpyb repo has some... eccentricities at the moment, that may be fixed soon. 
    

    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xcb/xpyb
    cd xpyb

Now, edit configure.ac, and change the version from 1.2 to 1.3.

    mkdir m4
    ./configure --disable-drm2
    make
    sudo make install


cairo
-----

    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/cairo
    ./configure --enable-xcb
    make
    sudo make install


py2cairo
--------

    git clone git://git.cairographics.org/git/py2cairo
    cd py2cairo
    ./configure

Check the configure output to make sure that XPYB is correctly detected.

    make
    sudo make install


PyGTK
-----

We also require a reasonably recent version of the Python GTK bindings, in
particular, the pango module. You should just be able to install this using
your chosen distribution's package manager.



If you plan to run the test suite, you will also need <a
