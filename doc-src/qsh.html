The Qtile command shell is a command-line shell interface that provides access
to the full complement of Qtile command functions. The shell features command
name completion, and full command documentation can be accessed from the shell
itself. The shell uses GNU Readline when it's available, so the interface can
be configured to, for example, obey VI keybindings with an appropriate .inputrc
file. See the GNU Readline documentation for more information.


Navigating the Object Graph
===========================

The shell presents a filesystem-like interface to the object graph - the
builtin "cd" and "ls" commmands act like their familiar shell counterparts:

<pre>
<!--(block | htmlescape)-->
> ls
layout/  widget/  screen/  bar/     window/  group/ 

> cd bar

bar> ls
bottom/

bar> cd bottom

bar['bottom']> ls
screen/

bar['bottom']> cd ../..

> ls
layout/  widget/  screen/  bar/     window/  group/ 
<!--(end)-->
</pre>

Note that the shell provides a "short-hand" for specifying node keys (as
opposed to children). The following is a valid shell path:

<pre>
<!--(block | htmlescape)-->
> cd group/4/window/31457314
<!--(end)-->
</pre>

The command prompt will, however, always display the Python node path that
should be used in scripts and key bindings:

<pre>
<!--(block | htmlescape)-->
group['4'].window[31457314]> 
<!--(end)-->
</pre>


Documentation
=============

The shell help provides the canonical documentation for the Qtile API:

<pre>
<!--(block | htmlescape)-->
> cd layout/1

layout[1]> help
help command   -- Help for a specific command.

Builtins:
=========
cd    exit  help  ls    q     quit

Commands for this object:
=========================
add           commands      current       delete        doc           down          get         
info          items         next          previous      rotate        shuffle_down  shuffle_up  
toggle_split  up          

layout[1]> help previous
previous()
Focus previous stack.
<!--(end)-->
</pre>
