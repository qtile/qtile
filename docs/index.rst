=======================================
Everything you need to know about Qtile
=======================================

Qtile is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager written and configured
in Python. It's available both as an X11 window manager and also as
:ref:`a Wayland compositor <wayland>`.

This documentation is designed to help you :doc:`install <manual/install/index>`
and :doc:`configure <manual/config/index>` Qtile. Once it's up and running you'll
probably want to start adding your own :doc:`customisations <manual/hacking>`
to have it running exactly the way you want.

You'll find a lot of what you need within these docs but, if you still have some
questions, you can find support in the following places:
