Autostart
=========

You might want to run some commands or spawn some applications when qtile starts. There is no prepared section in the default config or any autostart file either. Qtile provides you only the tools and let you do it on your own, so it can fit exactly to your needs.

There are lot of provided :doc:`Hooks </manual/config/hooks>`. In this case, you might especially be interested in ``startup`` and ``startup_once``. Clearly ``startup_once`` is emtited only once when you start qtile. It is not emitted on restarts. On the other side ``startup`` is emitted on the first start and even on restarts.

Hooks can be subscribed in your config and you can respond to them anyhow you want

.. code-block:: python

    @hook.subscribe.startup_once
    def autostart():
        # Do whatever you want


More advanced thing you might want to do is create autostart file with shell commands. For instance ``~/.config/qtile/autostart.sh``. Don't forget to set executable flag on it.


.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/sh
    feh --bg-scale ~/images/wallpaper.jpg &
    pidgin &
    dropbox start &


This kind of file can be run on qtile startup for example this way

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import subprocess


    @hook.subscribe.startup_once
    def autostart():
        home = os.path.expanduser("~")
        subprocess.Popen([home + "/.config/qtile/autostart.sh"])
