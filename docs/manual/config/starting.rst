Starting Qtile
==============

There are several ways to start Qtile. The most common way is via an entry in
your X session manager's menu. The default Qtile behavior can be invoked by
creating a `qtile.desktop
<https://github.com/qtile/qtile/blob/master/resources/qtile.desktop>`_ file in
``/usr/share/xsessions``.

A second way to start Qtile is a custom X session. This way allows you to
invoke Qtile with custom arguments, and also allows you to do any setup you
want (e.g. special keyboard bindings like mapping caps lock to control, setting
your desktop background, etc.) before Qtile starts. If you're using an X
session manager, you still may need to create a ``custom.desktop`` file similar
to the ``qtile.desktop`` file above, but with ``Exec=/etc/X11/xsession``. Then,
create your own ``~/.xsession``. There are several examples of user defined
``xsession`` s in the `qtile-examples
<https://github.com/qtile/qtile-examples>`_ repository.
