Reporting bugs
==============

Perhaps the easiest way to contribute to Qtile is to report any bugs you
run into on the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/qtile/qtile/issues>`_.

Useful bug reports are ones that get bugs fixed. A useful bug report normally
has two qualities:

1. **Reproducible.** If your bug is not reproducible it will never get fixed.
   You should clearly mention the steps to reproduce the bug. Do not assume or
   skip any reproducing step. Described the issue, step-by-step, so that it is
   easy to reproduce and fix.

2. **Specific.** Do not write a essay about the problem. Be Specific and to the
   point. Try to summarize the problem in minimum words yet in effective way.
   Do not combine multiple problems even they seem to be similar. Write
   different reports for each problem.
