Hacking on Qtile
================

Requirements
============

Any reasonably recent version of these should work, so you can probably just
install them from your package manager.

* `Nose <http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
* `Xephyr <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Xephyr>`_
* ``xeyes`` and ``xclock``

On ubuntu, this can be done with ``sudo apt-get install python-nose
xserver-xephyr x11-apps``.

Using Xephyr and the test suite
===============================

Qtile has a very extensive test suite, using the Xephyr nested X server. When
tests are run, a nested X server with a nested instance of Qtile is fired up,
and then tests interact with the Qtile instance through the client API. The
fact that we can do this is a great demonstration of just how completely
scriptable Qtile is. In fact, Qtile is designed expressly to be scriptable
enough to allow unit testing in a nested environment.

The Qtile repo includes a tiny helper script to let you quickly pull up a
nested instance of Qtile in Xephyr, using your current configuration.
Run it from the top-level of the repository, like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./scripts/xephyr

In practice, the development cycle looks something like this:

1. make minor code change
#. run appropriate test: ``nosetests --tests=test_module``
#. GOTO 1, until hackage is complete
#. run entire test suite: ``nosetests``
#. commit

Second X Session
================

Some users prefer to test Qtile in a second, completely separate X session:
Just switch to a new tty and run ``startx`` normally to use the ``~/.xinitrc``
X startup script.

It's likely though that you want to use a different, customized startup script
for testing purposes, for example ``~/.config/qtile/xinitrc``. You can do so by
launching X with:

.. code-block:: bash

  startx ~/.config/qtile/xinitrc

``startx`` deals with multiple X sessions automatically. If you want to use
``xinit`` instead, you need to first copy ``/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc`` to
``~/.xserverrc``; when launching it, you have to specify a new session number:

.. code-block:: bash

  xinit ~/.config/qtile/xinitrc -- :1

Examples of custom X startup scripts are available in `qtile-examples
<https://github.com/qtile/qtile-examples>`_.

Coding style
============

While not all of our code follows `PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_,
we do try to adhere to it where possible. All new code should be PEP8 compliant.

The ``make lint`` command will run a linter with our configuration over libqtile
to ensure your patch complies with reasonable formatting constraints. We also
request that git commit messages follow the
`standard format <http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>`_.

Deprecation policy
==================

When a widget API is changed, you should deprecate the change using
``libqtile.widget.base.deprecated`` to warn users, in additon to adding it to
the appropriate place in the changelog. We will typically remove deprecated
APIs one tag after they are deprecated.

Testing
=======

Of course, your patches should also pass the unit tests as well (i.e.
``make check``). These will be run by travis-ci on every pull request so you
can see whether or not your contribution passes.

Resources
=========

Here are a number of resources that may come in handy:

* `Inter-Client Conventions Manual <http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/>`_
* `Extended Window Manager Hints <http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html>`_
* `A reasonable basic Xlib Manual <http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/>`_
