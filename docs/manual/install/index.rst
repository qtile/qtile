Installing From Source
======================

Python interpreters
-------------------

We aim to always support the last three versions of CPython, the reference
Python interpreter. We usually support the latest stable version of PyPy_ as
well. You can check the versions and interpreters we currently run our test
suite against in our `tox configuration file`_.

There are not many differences between versions aside from Python features you
may or may not be able to use in your config. PyPy should be faster at runtime
than any corresponding CPython version under most circumstances, especially for
bits of Python code that are run many times. CPython should start up faster than
PyPy and has better compatibility for external libraries.

Core Dependencies
-----------------

Here are Qtile's core runtime dependencies and the package names that provide them 
in Ubuntu. Note that Qtile can run with one of two backends -- X11 and Wayland -- so 
only the dependencies of one of these is required.

Qtile
-----

With the dependencies in place, you can now install the stable version of qtile from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install qtile

Or with sets of dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install qtile[wayland]  # for Wayland dependencies
   pip install qtile[widgets]  # for all widget dependencies
   pip install qtile[all]      # for all dependencies

Or install qtile-git with:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/qtile/qtile.git
    cd qtile
    pip install .
    pip install --config-setting backend=wayland .  # adds wayland dependencies

.. _starting-qtile:

Starting Qtile
==============

There are several ways to start Qtile. The most common way is via an entry in
your X session manager's menu. The default Qtile behavior can be invoked by
creating a `qtile.desktop
<https://github.com/qtile/qtile/blob/master/resources/qtile.desktop>`_ file in
``/usr/share/xsessions``.

A second way to start Qtile is a custom X session. This way allows you to
invoke Qtile with custom arguments, and also allows you to do any setup you
want (e.g. special keyboard bindings like mapping caps lock to control, setting
your desktop background, etc.) before Qtile starts. If you're using an X
session manager, you still may need to create a ``custom.desktop`` file similar
to the ``qtile.desktop`` file above, but with ``Exec=/etc/X11/xsession``. Then,
create your own ``~/.xsession``. There are several examples of user defined
``xsession`` s in the `qtile-examples
<https://github.com/qtile/qtile-examples>`_ repository.

If there is no display manager such as SDDM, LightDM or other and there is need
to start Qtile directly from ``~/.xinitrc`` do that by adding 
``exec qtile start`` at the end.

In very special cases, ex. Qtile crashing during session, then suggestion would
be to start through a loop to save running applications:

.. code-block:: bash

    while true; do
        qtile
    done

Finally, if you're a gnome user, you can start integrate Qtile into Gnome's
session manager and use gnome as usual.

Wayland
=======

Qtile can be run as a Wayland compositor rather than an X11 window manager. For
this, Qtile uses wlroots_, a compositor library which is undergoing fast
development. Be aware that some distributions package outdated versions of
wlroots. More up-to-date distributions such as Arch Linux may package
pywayland, pywlroots and python-xkbcommon. Also note that we may not have yet
caught up with the latest wlroots release ourselves.

.. note::
   We currently support wlroots==0.16.0,<0.17.0 and pywlroots==0.16.4.

With the Wayland dependencies in place, Qtile can be run either from a TTY, or
within an existing X11 or Wayland session where it will run inside a nested
window:

.. code-block:: bash

    qtile start -b wayland

See the :ref:`Wayland <wayland>` page for more information on running Qtile as
a Wayland compositor.

Similar to the xsession example above, a wayland session file can be used to start qtile
from a login manager. To use this, you should create a `qtile-wayland.desktop
<https://github.com/qtile/qtile/blob/master/resources/qtile-wayland.desktop>`_ file in
``/usr/share/wayland-sessions``.
