===================================
Current Wayland Situation in Qtile
===================================

.. _wayland_status:

A lot of people have been asking about the current status of Qtile's Wayland backend.
Questions like:

- "Why is Qtile stuck on ``wlroots 0.17.0``?"
- "When will feature X be implemented?"

Instead of answering individually, this write-up should clarify things for everyone.

----

A Look Back
===========

.. _look_back:

Qtile's Wayland backend has been built on `pywlroots <https://github.com/flacjacket/pywlroots>`_ since day one — a Python binding to the ``wlroots`` library via ``cffi``.

It served us decently for a while, but over time, its limitations started to outweigh the benefits.

Why pywlroots became a problem
------------------------------

1. **Stalled Development**  

- ``pywlroots`` hasn't had a release since **May 13, 2024**, and `Jwijenbergh <https://github.com/jwijenbergh>`_ (a Qtile maintainer and the lead dev on the Wayland side) had to take over maintenance.

2. **No Direct Access to Wlroots**

- Less control over low-level behavior.
- Inefficient resource handling compared to working directly in C.

3. **Maintenance Nightmare**

- Track upstream ``wlroots`` changes.
- Update the Python bindings.
- Translate C semantics to Python.
- Update Qtile's Python side to use new APIs.

  **It's a constant uphill battle.**

4. **Blocked Features**  

Key features like **gamma control** can't be implemented cleanly due to wrapper limitations.

The New Path
============

.. _new_path:

Maintaining the Wayland backend this way became **unsustainable**. So **Jwijenbergh** proposed something bold:

- **Rewriting the Wayland backend in C with direct access to `wlroots`.**

This would:

- **Improve performance.**
- **Allow tighter integration.**
- **Make updates easier.**
- **Cut out the middleman (`pywlroots`).**

This change also makes Qtile's backend more future-proof and aligns it closer to what other compositors like sway or river do.

From Discord (tl;dr)
---------------------

.. code-block:: text

    @Jwijenbergh: im currently rewriting the wayland backend in C ...
    @Sigmanificient: OH, i absolutely love C, i would love to help you on this
    @Jwijenbergh: ok I will push a branch tomorrow
    @Jwijenbergh: it's a lot of work and I don't have a lot of time 
    @Gurjaka: c or cython?
    @Jwijenbergh: c
    ...
    @Gurjaka: So you are doing what hyprland did? Going independent from wlroots?
    @Jwijenbergh: no, just writing the compositor part in C with wlroots, without pywlroots

Current Status
==============

.. _current_status:

We've started working on this in a dedicated branch:  
`wayc <https://github.com/qtile/qtile/tree/wayc>`_ in the main Qtile repo.

What's Done
-----------

- Input/output device handling
- View & XDG-view management
- Initial WayC server setup
- Switched to ``wlroots 0.19``
- Logging and debugging (QW logs)
- Fullscreen/maximize request handling
- Gamma control manager
- Simulated keypress restoration
- XDG window names and app IDs
- Resize/move handling
- Cleaned up unnecessary dependencies
- Flake dev shell update
- XDG activation support

Work in Progress
----------------

- Layer shell / Z-ordering
- XWayland support
- Layout system
- Tests and refactoring
