        If you have certain apps that you always want to float you can provide
        ``float_rules`` to do so. ``float_rules`` are a list of
        Match objects::

            from libqtile.config import Match
            Match(title=WM_NAME, wm_class=WM_CLASS, role=WM_WINDOW_ROLE)

        When a new window is opened its ``match`` method is called with each of
        these rules.  If one matches, the window will float.  The following
        will float GIMP and Skype::

            from libqtile.config import Match
            float_rules=[Match(wm_class="skype"), Match(wm_class="gimp")]

        Specify these in the ``floating_layout`` in your config.

        Floating layout will try to center most of floating windows by default,
        but if you don't want this to happen for certain windows that are
        centered by mistake, you can use ``no_reposition_rules`` option to
        specify them and layout will rely on windows to position themselves in
        correct location on the screen.
