        If you have certain apps that you always want to float you can provide
        ``float_rules`` to do so. ``float_rules`` is a list of
        dictionaries containing some or all of the keys::

            {'wname': WM_NAME, 'wmclass': WM_CLASS, 'role': WM_WINDOW_ROLE}

        The keys must be specified as above.  You only need one, but
        you need to provide the value for it.  When a new window is
        opened it's ``match`` method is called with each of these
        rules.  If one matches, the window will float.  The following
        will float gimp and skype::

            float_rules=[dict(wmclass="skype"), dict(wmclass="gimp")]

        Specify these in the ``floating_layout`` in your config.

        Floating layout will try to center most of floating windows by
        default (until hints are properly implemented), but if you don't
        want this to happen for certain windows that are centered by mistake,
        you can use ``no_reposition_match`` option to specify them and layout
        will rely on windows to position themselves in correct location on
        the screen.
