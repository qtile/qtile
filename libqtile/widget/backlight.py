    """A simple widget to show the current brightness of a monitor.

    If the change_command parameter is set to None, the widget will attempt to
    use the interface at /sys/class to change brightness. Depending on the
    setup, the user may need to be added to the video group to have permission
    to write to this interface. This depends on having the correct udev rules
    the brightness file; these are typically installed alongside brightness
    tools such as brightnessctl (which changes the group to 'video') so
    installing that is an easy way to get it working.

    You can also bind keyboard shortcuts to the backlight widget with:
