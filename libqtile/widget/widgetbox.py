    WidgetBox is a widget that hides widgets by default but shows them when
    the box is opened.

    Widgets that are hidden will still update etc. as if they were on the main
    bar.

    Button clicks are passed to widgets when they are visible so callbacks will
    work.

    Widgets in the box also remain accessible via command interfaces.

    Widgets can only be added to the box via the configuration file. The widget
    is configured by adding widgets to the "widgets" parameter as follows::

        widget.WidgetBox(widgets=[
            widget.TextBox(text="This widget is in the box"),
