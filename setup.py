A pure-Python tiling window manager.

Features
========

    * Simple, small and extensible. It's easy to write your own layouts,
      widgets and commands.
    * Configured in Python.
    * Command shell that allows all aspects of
      Qtile to be managed and inspected.
    * Complete remote scriptability - write scripts to set up workspaces,
      manipulate windows, update status bar widgets and more.
    * Qtile's remote scriptability makes it one of the most thoroughly
      unit-tested window mangers around.

Qtile depends on the Python X Library (http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net/).
