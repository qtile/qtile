# any mistakes that inadvertently breakag widgets.

# By default, the test runs on every widget that is listed in __init__.py
# This is done by building a list called `parameters` which contains a tuple of
# (widget class, kwargs).
#
# Adjustments to the tests can be made below.

# Some widgets may require certain parameters to be set when initialising.
# Widgets listed here will replace the default values.
# This should be used as a last resort - any failure may indicate an
# underlying issue in the widget that should be resolved.
